 description2: Ghidra is a powerful, free, and open-source software framework designed for reverse engineering. Developed by the National Security Agency (NSA), it provides a comprehensive suite of tools for analyzing and understanding compiled code. Ghidra's capabilities include disassembling binaries, decompiling them into higher-level code, and performing various static and dynamic analyses. This makes it an invaluable resource for security researchers, malware analysts, and software developers seeking to understand the inner workings of applications and systems.
