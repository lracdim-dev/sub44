 description2: Mastodon.org isn't exactly a social media platform itself, but rather a launchpad for exploring a decentralized social network. It allows you to sign up for individual servers (called "instances") focused on specific interests or regions. These servers all connect with each other, letting you follow and interact with people on different instances, similar to how email works across different providers. This creates a more community-driven experience, where users have more control over their data and who they interact with.
