 description2: MinIO is a high-performance storage system designed for large amounts of unstructured data, like photos, videos, and backups. It's completely free and open-source software, and even though it's not directly affiliated with Amazon, it can be used just like Amazon's S3 cloud storage service. This makes it easy to switch your data storage to MinIO if you're already familiar with S3. MinIO is known for its speed and scalability, making it a popular choice for businesses with growing data needs, especially those working in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
