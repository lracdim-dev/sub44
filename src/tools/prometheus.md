 description2: Prometheus.io offers an open-source monitoring system built for the cloud-native world. It excels at collecting metrics – data points that track a system's health – from various sources and storing them efficiently.  Prometheus allows you to analyze this data using a powerful query language and visualize it through built-in tools or integrations with dashboards like Grafana. This lets you gain valuable insights into your system's performance and quickly identify any issues that might arise.
